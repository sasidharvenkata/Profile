# Runku Venkata Sasidhar
Hi, I'm sasidhar (she/her)—a Data Scientist at Apporchid India limited working on AI to support machine learning frameworks. Previously worked on the Innoplexus india to help recommendations on keyword search. I live in Hyderabad, Telangana and Andhra native. 🙌 I'm a huge nerd/geek, comicon, and aspiring kaggler.

## My values
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain.
